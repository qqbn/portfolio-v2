    "projects": "In my free time, I love to spend time coding and creating new things. Over the years, I have worked on a variety of web applications, each reflecting my passion for innovative design and efficient functionality. From developing user-friendly interfaces to implementing backend systems. Some of them are deployed in the Internet, so you can play with them as much as you want. Also, there's a Github repo link attached to every project, so you can dive into code."
